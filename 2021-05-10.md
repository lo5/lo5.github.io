### WaveDB benchmarks

WaveDB now has a `-benchmark` arg, which attempts to find out how many concurrent goroutines can read/write from/to a database table without failures. 

Each benchmark iteration doubles the number of concurrent goroutines until at least one encounters "failed to open database", after which the number of goroutines is dialed back until all goroutines succeed.

    func findConcurrency(ds *DS, b benchmark) (int, int) {
      trials := 0
      min, max, n := 0, 0, 1
      for {
        trials++
        if runBenchmark(ds, b, n) {
          min = n
          if max == 0 {
            n *= 2
            continue
          }
        } else {
          max = n
        }
        n = min + (max-min)/2
        if max-min <= 1 {
          break
        }
      }
      return n, trials
    }
