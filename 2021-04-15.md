# App protocol docs

## Done 

x document app protocol

## Notes

the [R driver](https://github.com/h2oai/wave/tree/master/r) got built without any existing documentation on the wire protocol. ashrith reverse-engineered it from the server logs, which was sub-optimal. the [app server protocol](https://github.com/h2oai/wave/blob/master/protocol.md) is documented now.

seems like the folks at Packt publishing are reaching out to everyone involved for a Wave book. improving our publicly available docs, tutorials and examples would be a better use of our time, at least during 2021. also, we'd need two books now - Python and R :)
