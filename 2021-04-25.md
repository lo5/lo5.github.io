## Notes

this journal now uses a handlebars template, and is generated with about 50 lines of coffeescript.

it's always a pleasure writing coffeescript. typescript feels like ASCII art in comparison, except for static typing, which is critical for anything but the most trivial programs, like this one.

coffeeScript would be the bomb with static typing. i had [opened an issue](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/issues/2576) about this almost a decade ago, and has since gotten [Flow integration](https://coffeescript.org/#type-annotations), but the `### foo ###` syntax for type annotations is bizarre. [Purescript](https://www.purescript.org/) comes close, but deviates significantly from javascript semantics, making it less palatable to programmers unfamiliar with the ML family.
