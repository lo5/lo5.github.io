## Notes

the app query-handling bits were carried over from the previous websocket-based implementation. the refactored version is bog-standard HTTP request handling. should considerably simplify implementation when we hook up the R driver to `httpuv`. also allows poking at the  app server using cURL/httpie/etc.

the Python app server is now locked down using HTTP basic auth, by default (no opt out). the app server generates a new access key/secret pair on launch and passes it on to the Wave server during the handshake. non-Wave-forwarded requests are denied.
