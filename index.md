I've seen many chefs who are self-critical, but I've never seen a chef who is so hard on himself. He sets the standard for self-discipline. He is always looking ahead. He is never satisfied with his work. He is always trying to find ways to make sushi better, or to improve his skills. Even now, that's what he thinks about all day, every day. 

A great chef has the following five attributes:

- First, they take their work very seriously, and consistently perform on the highest level.
- Second, they aspire to improve their skills.
- Third is cleanliness. (If the restaurant doesn't feel clean, the food isn't going to taste good.)
- The fourth attribute is impatience. They are better leaders than collaborators. They are stubborn and insist on having it their way. 
- And, finally, a great chef is passionate.
