# Prithvi Prabhu

I work at the intersection of computing and design to explore and invent new ways of interacting with information. I author software that makes it simple, fast, fun and easy to discover, interpret and communicate patterns in data.

I am interested in:

- High-performance graphics, real-time information visualization, data visualization, visual analytics and self-service decision support systems.
- Research and development of novel HCI techniques for interactive exploration and analysis of large-scale data.
- Patterns, practices and programming strategies for building robust, large-scale, highly interactive analytical systems.
- Symbolic computing, interactive computing, distributed systems, compilers and DSLs.

# Work

I've founded or been an early engineer in three startups.

I currently work at [H2O.ai](https://h2o.ai) (Mountain View, California) as Chief of Technology, a fancy title for "mostly programmer, programming" (10,000+ commits in Github since March 2014).

I head the development of **[H2O Q](https://www.h2o.ai/h2o-q/)**, an analytical decision-support platform that involves several interesting technologies including real-time information visualization, search-driven exploratory data analysis, information retrieval and augmented analytics. H2O Q has a novel language-agnostic rapid application development system for authoring interactive real-time information displays and applications.

I consider myself incredibly fortunate to be working with some of the [smartest](https://youtu.be/xAhQAYV5_PY?t=23) [people](https://twitter.com/CrunchingData/status/1187627135952769029) in machine learning, including [Leland Wilkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leland_Wilkinson) of [Grammar of Graphics](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387245447) fame, and hacker extraordinaire [Cliff Click](https://www.infoq.com/profile/Cliff-Click/), who have been a constant source of inspiration for almost everything I've done over the past decade.

In the past, I have been responsible for:

- **[Driverless AI](https://www.h2o.ai/products/h2o-driverless-ai/)** - H2O.ai's flagship automatic machine learning platform.
- **Driverless AI for Excel** - A native add-in for automatic machine learning in Microsoft Excel.
- **[Flow](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-flow)** - a [hybrid GUI + REPL](https://www.h2o.ai/blog/introducing-flow/) environment for exploratory data analysis and machine learning. You can see it in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=h2o+flow). There is also a [book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-machine-learning/9781491964590/) about it.
- **[Steam](http://docs.h2o.ai/steam/latest-stable/index.html)** - a platform for cluster management, experiment hosting/execution, model management and model deployment.
- **Echo** - a real-time dashboard system (folded into H2O Q).
- **Flux** - a rapid application development system (folded into H2O Q).
- **[H2O.js](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o.js)** - a Javascript-to-Rapids transpiler for executing a subset of Javascript on H2O for machine learning at scale.
- **[Lightning](https://github.com/h2oai/lightning)** - Statistical graphics library for browsers.
- **[Play](http://play.h2o.ai/)** - On-demand H2O cloud provisioning and management on AWS.
- **H2O Excel Add-in** - Predictive array-formulae for spreadsheet data.


Previously in 2010, I founded [Plot.io](https://twitter.com/plot_io), a web-based interactive visual analytics system based on Leland Wilkinson's [Grammar of Graphics](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387245447). You can see it in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuJkLL3TgZXYRDcRxKL-Z0FFUEUmAs0US).

I was especially proud of the front-end, which was originally authored in a custom Lisp dialect, transpiled to Coffeescript, then Javascript. The programming paradigm was inspired by [Flapjax](https://www.flapjax-lang.org/), based on [functional reactive programming](https://wiki.haskell.org/Functional_Reactive_Programming) and [flow-based programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming), long before Elm or React/Redux were a thing. The entire user interface and visualization/rendering library minified down to ~150KB, a fourth of the size of the average web page back in 2010.

Plot.io was acquired by [Platfora](https://platfora.com/) in 2012, which in turn was acquired by [Workday](https://www.workday.com/) in 2016. The product is currently called [Prism](https://www.workday.com/en-us/products/analytics-reporting/overview.html).

Previously I used to be in technology consulting with 3Com, Abbott, Aon, Astra Zeneca, Elan, Genworth Financial, Glaxo SmithKline, Healthways, Herbalife, Metlife, Northwestern Mutual, Pfizer, Sun Microsystems and XL Re, via Infosys.
