# R Driver

## Done

x more back and forth / review on R driver
x basic `wavegen` docs

## Notes

R's S3 vs R6 vs S4 is bothersome. difficult to please everyone. maybe the R driver will end up with both a OOP and a functional API that do the same things. both parties can be happy that way. R's lack of qualified imports is going to cause a lot of pain.
