# Merge R driver

## Done

x merge R driver :)
x R-base docker image
x R driver build dockerfile

## Notes

docker on Arch needs additional configuration to get working properly. containers can't use host networking by default. 

add this:

    $ cat /etc/docker/daemon.json
    { "dns": [ "8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4" ] }


now containers with `--network host` work as expected.
