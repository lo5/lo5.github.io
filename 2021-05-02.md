## Notes

### [Re-trigger hash routing](https://github.com/h2oai/wave/issues/769)?

Our front-end implementation is based on [the browser's hashchange event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/hashchange_event). If there is no change in the hash, the change event is not triggered, by definition.

https://github.com/h2oai/wave/blob/d1980bb4f5f1a1251ded9bf0641b53f6794e8714/ui/src/app.tsx#L118-L128

We could change the front-end implementation to force-trigger the event regardless of whether it has changed, but this could break existing apps which rely on the current behavior and whose hash routing handlers are not idempotent.

In this case, it seems to me like the correct way to implement flow is: when the user "operates on the new page", it should cause hash changes to something other than `#routing1`, so that when the user goes back to `#routing1`, it gets triggered.

For example (changes in **bold**):
- A user clicks on navigation button with hash routing `#routing1`
- User navigates to http://localhost:10101/#routing1 which is also the current URL
- User operates on the new page, **causing the hash to change to `#routing1/action1`, `#routing1/action2`, etc.**
- User clicks again on the same navigation button to reset the page / navigate back
- Hash routing **is triggered, since active URL has changed**
