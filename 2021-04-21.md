# R Driver PR

## Done

x review R driver internals


## Notes

we need Python-equivalent:

- `site = Site('http://example.com')` (grabbing a reference to a site)
- `page = site['/foo/bar']` (grabbing a reference to a page in the site)
- `site.upload(...)`, `site.unload(...)`, `site.download(...)` (site manipulation)

post-implementation, the following should be possible:

manipulate multiple pages from the same site:

    s <- .Site$new('http://foo.com')
    p1 <- s$get('/stats/cricket') # mints a new page from the site s
    p2 <- s$get('/stats/hockey') # mints another page from the site s
    p1$set(....)
    p2$set(....)

manipulate multiple pages on multiple sites:

    s1 <- .Site$new('http://foo.com')
    p1 <- s1$get('/stats/cricket')
    s2 <- .Site.new('http://bar.com')
    p2 <- s2$get('/stats/hockey')
    p1$set(....)
    p2$set(....)

manipulate multiple sites:

    s1 <- .Site$new('http://foo.com')
    s1$upload('cricket_scores.csv')
    s2 <- .Site.new('http://bar.com')
    s2$upload('hockey_scores.csv')


the python driver exports both `site` (noun) and `Site` (verb / constructor). 

difference is: `Site()` mints a new instance of a site, and `site` is shorthand for a `Site()` that already points to `$H2O_WAVE_ADDRESS` using `$H2O_WAVE_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`$H2O_WAVE_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET` for auth.

so for now, it's fine to not expose the R6 `Site()` in the API, but structure the API in a way that let's us demonstrate the 3 examples above in a future release.

in other words: only export a pre-created `site`, and the `$get` on the `site` to get an instance of the page, and we can do the `Site()` part later.more notes:
