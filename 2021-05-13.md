# Refactor h2o-wave

## Done

x connect() in browser module shouldn't accept `/_s`
x make h2o-wave npm package leaner

## Notes

The NPM package needs a formal API so that apps using third-party Javascript libs on the front-end can capture and send the events to the Python app. Events are not special-cased in the daemon, so no changes are required there. Cleaning up the NPM package will also open up possibilities for building Wave apps using entirely custom (non-Fluent) user interfaces, like Bootstrap or Blueprint or Material Design. Obviously this requires knowledge of HTML and CSS in addition to Python, but I"m hoping we can continue sticking to "no Javascript required".

### Performance

A significant change that's needed to the front-end kernel is to emit events at a more granular level. Currently, events are emitted for "page changed" and "card changed", but the handlers don't know what exactly changed. This is not much of a problem when using React since it resorts to diff-ing anyway, but is likely to be an issue with non-vdom renderers. This needs to change. 

The proof-of-concept [Handlebars based implementation](https://github.com/h2oai/wave/blob/6695621b3d4bbfb239836b071e13b1c8cd741252/u/index.ts), for example, brute-force renders the entire page on incremental changes to cards.
