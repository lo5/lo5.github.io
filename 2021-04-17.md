# Pacman

## Done 

x fix OS on workstation

## Notes

Pop_OS (or Ubuntu?) driver update hosed gnome terminal late yesterday, started redrawing on every other keystroke (?); made vi unusable. 

wanted to switch to Arch for a couple of years now, and this was as good a tipping point as any.

installation was straightforward, except that the base install does not include everything that the liveUSB ships with, notably network management. realized this too late, after the post-install reboot. the workstation is not hard-wired, and no `iwd` was installed. had to reboot from liveUSB again to get `iwd`, then use `iwctl` to scan/connect to the station.

pacman commands not immediately obvious from manpage:

    # search packages for foo
    $ pacman -Ss foo

    # search local packages for foo
    $ pacman -Qs foo

    # info on package foo
    $ pacman -Si foo

    # info on local package foo
    $ pacman -Qi foo

    # search for packages that provide foo
    $ pacman -F foo

    # what have I explicitly installed?
    $ pacman -Qe
